    <p><b>Interest in IT industry</b>: Once I realized that I'm currently working in a dying industry(Automotive Industry - Dealership), it triggered my interest to change my career into an industry with a long bright future.
      With rapid changes around the world in the technology world, I found that IT was the industry to be in. With luck, I was able to do business with a highly successful client 
      who is a General Manager for one of the major IT company in the world. Through this client, I was able to get some advices on what I should do prior to changing the industry
      and furthermore, this client was the one to recommend me to take on this course as I have no experience in IT field to show the initiatives to any recruiters. Through this course, 
      I expect to learn the basics of IT to further develope my skills to help me progress as a successful technical sales rep.<p>

      <p><img src="https://github.com/Wonny1/first-publish/blob/master/Ideal%20Job.jpg.png?raw=true"><p>
      
     <p><b>Description of the role</b>: Ability to deal with all different types of clients(From C-Suite level to small business owners) to sell Microsoft Azure Cloud technology.
       This job is appealing to myself as I have a large sales experience in the automotive industry from Toyota, all the way upto Mercedes Benz and my interest in the Cloud technology 
       system. The typical skills required for this job are the people skills and essential experience required for this role is minimum 3-5 years experience in the sales field in my
       opinion. Given my people skills and the ability to sell to all different types of people with my B2C and B2B experience of 7+ years, and deep understanding of the psychology of 
       selling, I think this job is ideal for me. The ad mentions a very specific requirements such as:<p>
       
       <p>1. Several years of technology related sales or business development experience<p>
       <p>2. Ability to explain complex technical solutions to technical and non-technical audiences<p>
       
       <p>which I hope to develop by starting from the bottom and develop the skills from working towards the top within the industry. Given the size of Microsoft, it is unlikely that I
    will be able to start with Microsoft as my first job in the IT field. Therefore, I would look to start with a smaller IT company first to develope the basic IT skills than target Microsoft.<p>
    
    <h1>Personality Test</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/29a622aab99d1">Myers-Briggs Test</a>
    <p><a href="https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=59-54-69&name_key=b790436ccc">Learning Tyle Test</a>
    <p><a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-test/13683/test-results/7958311">Big 5 Personality Test</a>
      
    <p>These results are somewhat expected. I have always believed that I am better suited to a management position as per the Myers-Briggs Test shows. However, the Commander temperament 
      is always known for their arrogance or dominance as their weekness which I should be conscious of as this could effect the teamwork in a negative way. When I need to form a team, 
      it would be wise to be conscious of this characteristics to avoid any unneccesary conflict between team members due to my arrogance. In addition, I've learned that I learn best through hearing, 
      seeing, and doing as per the <a href="https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=59-54-69&name_key=b790436ccc">Learning Tyle Test</a>. Therefore, I'm sure I'll be able to learn faster by forming a team with someone that has the skills in relation to the project and by working with that individual, I'll be able 
      to adapt and learn faster as working as a team. Or perhaps, to maximize my potential, I could be forming a team who enjoys demonstrating their skills that I can learn from.
      
    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
      <p><b>Overview</b><p>
      <p>A cloud networking system application that will connect dealerships or vehicle retailers that are in need of second hand vehicles and private sellers directly and purchasing through 
        a auction/bidding system. Since dealerships are in constant need of second hand vehicles, the private sellers can list their vehicles for sale through auction/bidding system and the 
        dealership who are the bidders can all make biddings to purchase the vehicle. The private sellers will need to upload a list of photos for the bidders to see and the highest bidder will win.<p>
        
        <p><b>Motivation</b><p>
        <p>In Australian market, people change their vehicles on the average of 5 to 6 years which means they sell their cars every 5 to 6 years only. As private sellers lack the skills to sell
          their vehicles and this application could make it easier for the sellers to get a fair price for their car but also, gives opportunities to the dealership to buy second hand vehicles that
          could significantly impact the automotive industry. I see a big potential in this system as sellers usually do not like to interact with dealers or car salesman and this application will 
          allow the sellers to sell through stress-free experience without any physical interaction<p>
          
        <p><b>Description</b><p>
        <p>When a seller decides to sell their vehicle through this application, first step is to upload details of the vehicle which will be entered in both manually(odometer, registration number, 
          built date etc) as well as the photos of the vehicle. An outline of how to take the photos will be overlaid through the in-app camera to guide the sellers on how to take the photos with the best possible angle to reduce the 
          confusion to the bidders. All the details required from the seller will be guided through the application to provide a smooth and stress-free experience as sellers usually do not know where to find the information required. Once 
          the vehicle is uploaded for sale on the app, the vehicle will be listed available for bidding for a limited time. From this point, the bidders will be able to start the bidding but further revenue
          can be raised from here as the bidders will be limited to view the bidding prices to see who made the highest bidding unless they use the credit that is available through in-app purchases. 
    The identity/details of the vehicle seller will remain hidden until the vehicle bidding is finalized. The contact details of the seller will be shown to the highest bidder to finalize the sale. The seller
    will need to pay either a fixed fee or a certain percentage of the sale price to the application.<p>
    
            <p><b>Tools and Technologies</b><p>
    <p>First software tool would be tools such as <a href="https://appery.io/">appery.io</a> to create the application itself. For online payment methods such as <a href="https://pay.google.com/about/">Google Pay</a> can be used
      for reliable system. Also, one of the most crucial part of this app would be the application security as it will hold the details of not only the seller, but a payment details as well. From <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3317523/top-application-security-tools-for-2019.html">CSO</a>,
            There were many tools listed as one of the safest such as <a href="https://www.arxan.com/application-protection">Arxan Application Protection</a> which could be used as the security program for the app.
    
            <p><b>Skills required</b><p>
<p> The required skills will be relatively easy as long as the person making the app has the basic knowledge of creating an application. The examples of the required skills for making this application are camera overlay, cloud networking, 
  application security, etc. 2 most crucial part to this application will be to make sure the security is completely competent to make sure it block all external threats and access to make sure that the identity or the seller is not 
  exposed as well as the payment account details. Finding the skills required and software system for the application should be easy as the application itself is not a complicated as long as there is a reliable cloud system and making sure
  that there are minimal errors/bugs within the app.
  
            <p><b>Outcome</b><p>
    If the project turns out to be successful, it will make a significant impact on the industry as the people will be more motivated to sell their vehicle as it will make it easy for everyone to sell their vehicle. The problem of normal people
    not wanting to interact with Car salesman will be offered to sellers through this application and the worry of getting the correct price for your vehicle will be taken out of the equation through this application as the the vehicle will be 
    sold to the highest bidder which will give the seller a confience.
