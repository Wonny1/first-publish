    <p>Interest in IT industry: Once I realized that I'm currently working in a dying industry, it triggered my interest to change my career into an industry with a long bright future.
      With rapid changes around the world in the technology world, I found that IT was the industry to be in. With luck, I was able to do business with a highly successful client 
      who is a General Manager for one of the major IT company in the world. Through this client, I was able to get some advices on what I should do prior to changing the industry
      and furthermore, this client was the one to recommend me to take on this course as I have no experience in IT field to show the initiatives to any recruiters. Through this course, 
      I expect to learn the basics of IT to further develope my skills to help me progress as a successful technical sales rep.<p>
