       This job is appealing to myself as I have a large sales experience in the automotive industry from Toyota, all the way upto Mercedes Benz and my interest in the Cloud technology 
       system. The typical skills required for this job are the people skills and essential experience required for this role is minimum 3-5 years experience in the sales field in my
       opinion. Given my people skills and the ability to sell to all different types of people with my B2C and B2B experience of 7+ years, and deep understanding of the psychology of

    <h1>Personality Test</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/29a622aab99d1">Myers-Briggs Test</a>

    <p>These results are somewhat expected. I have always believed that I am better suited to a management position as per the Myers-Briggs Test shows. However, the Commander temperament 
      is always known for their arrogance or dominance as their weekness which I should be conscious of as this could effect the teamwork in a negative way. When I need to form a team, 
      it would be wise to be conscious of this characteristics to avoid any unneccesary conflict between team members due to my arrogance. In addition, I've learned that I learn by hearing, 
      seeing, and doing. Therefore, I'm sure I'll be able to learn faster by forming a team with someone that has knowledge of the project and by working with that individual, I'll be able 
      to adapt and learn faster as working as a team.
      
    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
      <p><b>Overview</b><p>
      <p>A cloud networking system application that will connect dealerships or vehicle retailers that are in need of second hand vehicles and private sellers directly and purchasing through 
        a auction/bidding system. Since dealerships are in constant need of second hand vehicles, the private sellers can list their vehicles for sale through auction/bidding system and the 
        dealership who are the bidders can all make biddings to purchase the vehicle. The private sellers will need to upload a list of photos for the bidders to see and the highest bidder will win.<p>
        
        <p><b>Motivation</b><p>
        <p>In Australian market, people change their vehicles on the average of 5 to 6 years which means they sell their cars every 5 to 6 years only. As private sellers lack the skills to sell
          their vehicles and this application could make it easier for the sellers to get a fair price for their car but also, gives opportunities to the dealership to buy second hand vehicles that
          could significantly impact the automotive industry. I see a big potential in this system as sellers usually do not like to interact with dealers or car salesman and this application will 
          allow the sellers to sell through stress-free experience without any physical interaction<p>
          
        <p><b>Description</b><p>
        <p>When a seller decides to sell their vehicle through this application, first step is to upload details of the vehicle which will be entered in both manually(odometer, registration number, 
          built date etc) as well as the photos of the vehicle. An outline of how to take the photos will be overlaid through the in-app camera to guide the sellers on how to take the photos with the best possible angle to reduce the 
          confusion to the bidders. All the details required from the seller will be guided through the application to provide a smooth and stress-free experience as sellers usually do not know where to find the information required. Once 
          the vehicle is uploaded for sale on the app, the vehicle will be listed available for bidding for a limited time. From this point, the bidders will be able to start the bidding but further revenue
          can be raised from here as the bidders will be limited to view the bidding prices to see who made the highest bidding unless they use the credit that is available through in-app purchases. 
    The identity/details of the vehicle seller will remain hidden until the vehicle bidding is finalized. The contact details of the seller will be shown to the highest bidder to finalize the sale. The seller
    will need to pay either a fixed fee or a certain percentage of the sale price to the application.<p>
    
            <p><b>Tools and Technologies</b><p>
    <p>First software tool would be tools such as <a href="https://appery.io/">appery.io</a> to create the application itself. For online payment methods such as <a href="https://pay.google.com/about/">Google Pay</a> can be used
      for reliable system. Also, one of the most crucial part of this app would be the application security as it will hold the details of not only the seller, but a payment details as well. From <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3317523/top-application-security-tools-for-2019.html">CSO</a>,
            There were many tools listed as one of the safest such as <a href="https://www.arxan.com/application-protection">Arxan Application Protection</a>.
